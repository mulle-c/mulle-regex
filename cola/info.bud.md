## Regular Expression Syntax

Generally the regular expression is the same to what you are used to in `sed`
or `grep`. But groups that can be used for replacement do _not_ need nor
must they be escaped by '\'.

So for example to juxtapose text separated by a comma, in **sed** you would
say `'s/\([^,]*\),\(.*\)/\2,\1/'`, but in **mulle-regex** it's `"([^,]*),(.*)"`
as the pattern and `"\2,\1/"` as the replacement string.

1. **Literals**: Any character can be a literal in a regexp. This includes alphanumeric characters, punctuation, and special characters. For example, `a`, `1`, `.`, etc.
2. **Special Characters**: Some characters have special meanings in regexp. These include:
   - `.`  : Matches any single character except newline.
   - `*`  : Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
   - `[]` : Defines a character class, matching any one character enclosed.
   - `^`  : Matches the start of the line.
   - `$`  : Matches the end of the line.
3. **Groups**: Characters can be grouped together using parentheses `()`. This is used to apply quantifiers to multiple characters or to define alternatives.
4. **Alternation**: The pipe `|` character is used to denote alternation, matching the pattern before or the pattern after the `|`.
5. **Quantifiers**: Quantifiers define how many times a character or group can occur. These include:
   - `?`: Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group.
   - `+`: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
6. **Backreferences**: The `\1`, `\2`, etc. syntax is used to refer to the contents of a previously matched group.
7. **Character Classes**: The `[:class:]` syntax is used to match any character in a specific class. For example, `[:alnum:]` matches any alphanumeric character.
